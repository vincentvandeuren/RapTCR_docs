# RapTCR: Rapid TCR repertoire visualization and annotation.

## Installation

RapTCR is available from [Anaconda]. To install it, including the necessary dependencies, use:

```bash
conda install raptcr -c conda-forge -c pytorch -c vincentvandeuren
```
{: .note }
RapTCR requires python >= 3.10. Hence, it may be necessary to create a new conda environment, as installing it in an older environment may fail.
